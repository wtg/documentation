# Documentation Guidelines

All WebTech projects require adequate documentation, as this assists with project maintenance for future years, especially after the original developers graduate. This file provides guidelines for documention to ensure a common standard within WebTech.

## Code Documentation

All significant files and functions should be accompanied by a [Docstring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring). These docstrings can be of any format (inline or block comment), but must provide the following details:
* What the function does / what the function is supposed to do
* Short description of the parameters and return type, along with expected data types if the language doesn't force you to specify in the code
